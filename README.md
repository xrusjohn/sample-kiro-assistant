# Kiro Coworker (Based on Agent Coworker)

Kiro Coworker is our customized build of the open-source Agent Coworker desktop shell. It keeps the familiar Electron + React UX while swapping the runtime for **Kiro CLI**, so you can use every model Kiro supports with session management, MCP tooling, and inline viewers.

- 🚀 **Native Electron desktop app** with hot-reloadable React/Tailwind renderer
- 🧠 **Powered entirely by `kiro-cli`** (no Claude CLI required)
- 🧩 **Full MCP coverage (stdio + HTTP)** surfaced inside Settings
- 📂 **Auto-provisioned workspaces** per session under `~/Documents/workspace-kiro-cowork/<task-id>`
- 💾 **SQLite-backed history** so conversations stream in real time and persist across launches

> Kiro Coworker is a fork of Agent Coworker. We kept the UX but rewired the runtime, configuration, and docs for the Kiro ecosystem.

## Model & Provider Compatibility

If a model works in `kiro-cli`, it works in Kiro Coworker: Claude (Anthropic API or Bedrock), Kimi K2, MiniMax M2, DeepSeek, GLM, etc. Configure providers once inside Kiro CLI and the desktop app automatically uses those settings.

![SQLite Polling Flow](images/SQLLite.png)

| Layer | Responsibilities | Key Files |
| ----- | ---------------- | --------- |
| **Electron Main** | Boots the BrowserWindow, exposes IPC APIs (`read-file`, `run-kiro-command`, MCP helpers), spawns `kiro-cli chat`, and copies uploads into per-session workspaces. | `src/electron/main.ts`, `src/electron/libs/runner.ts`, `src/electron/libs/mcp-config.ts`, `src/electron/libs/workspace.ts` |
| **React Renderer** | Zustand store + UI components (sessions, prompt bar, MCP settings, file sidebar, file upload, slash commands). | `src/ui/*` |
| **Kiro CLI runtime** | Talks to Anthropic-compatible APIs, executes tools, runs MCP servers, and writes conversation history to its SQLite store. | `/Applications/Kiro CLI.app` or `kiro-cli` on PATH |
| **Claude Agent SDK (helper)** | Only used for `generateSessionTitle()` to keep the automatic title suggestion feature. | `src/electron/libs/util.ts` |
| **Persistence** | Coworker metadata/history via `sessions.db`; conversation bodies live in Kiro’s own `~/Library/Application Support/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3`. | `src/electron/libs/session-store.ts` |

More details (mermaid diagrams, SQLite polling strategy, security notes) live in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`docs/INTEGRATION.md`](docs/INTEGRATION.md).

## Installing & Running

### Prerequisites

1. **Kiro CLI** installed and authenticated for your provider (Anthropic, Bedrock, Kimi, etc.).
2. **Claude CLI (optional)** only if you want the legacy helpers (e.g., `/skills`) inside Settings.
3. **Bun (preferred) or Node.js 18+** for building.
4. **macOS 13+** (the current build targets macOS; Windows/Linux scripts are stubbed but untested).

> Each new session auto-creates a workspace under `~/Documents/workspace-kiro-cowork/<task-id>`. Use the Upload button to place files into that sandbox; the UI no longer asks you to pick folders manually.

### Steps

```bash
# Clone from AWS GitLab
git clone https://gitlab.aws.dev/wwps-asean-sa-genai/Kiro-Cowork.git
cd Kiro-Cowork

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Development mode (Vite + Electron with hot reload)
bun run dev

# Production build (macOS arm64)
bun run dist:mac
```

The macOS bundle is emitted to `dist/mac-arm64/Kiro Coworker.app`. Copy it into `/Applications` (back up any previous version first).

> We spawn `kiro-cli chat --no-interactive --trust-all-tools --wrap never --model claude-opus-4.5 --agent kiro-coworker`. Override defaults with `KIRO_DEFAULT_MODEL` / `KIRO_AGENT` before launching the app.

## Custom Agent Configuration & MCPs

Kiro Coworker instantiates a custom agent named `kiro-coworker`. Its configuration lives in `~/.kiro/agents/agent_config.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "kiro-coworker",
  "description": "A custom agent for my workflow",
  "mcpServers": {
    "pencil": {
      "command": "/Applications/Pencil.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/out/mcp-server-darwin-arm64",
      "args": ["--ws-port", "53881"],
      "env": {},
      "type": "stdio",
      "disabled": false
    },
    "playwright": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"],
      "env": {},
      "disabled": false
    },
    "composio": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://backend.composio.dev/tool_router/trs_8YCbLt0jkO8_/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "x-api-key": "ak_Ra86dArRGY_2yiYPsia7"
      },
      "disabled": false
    },
    "zai-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@z_ai/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "Z_AI_API_KEY": "686a80f3d1e34141b9d1f6239b0b137e.iYhXKIWFWPXwjcpd",
        "Z_AI_MODE": "ZAI"
      },
      "disabled": false
    },
    "excel": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "@negokaz/excel-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "EXCEL_MCP_PAGING_CELLS_LIMIT": "4000"
      },
      "disabled": false
    }
  },
  "tools": [
    "@pencil","@composio","@playwright","@zai-mcp-server","@excel",
    "read","glob","grep","write","shell","aws","web_search","web_fetch",
    "introspect","report","knowledge","thinking","todo","use_subagent"
  ],
  "allowedTools": [
    "@pencil","@composio","@playwright","@zai-mcp-server","@excel",
    "read","glob","grep","write","shell","aws","web_search","web_fetch",
    "introspect","report","knowledge","thinking","todo","use_subagent"
  ],
  "resources": ["skill:///Users/you/.kiro/skills/**/SKILL.md"],
  "prompt": "You are a general purpose agent...",
  "model": "claude-opus-4.5"
}
```

- Edit this file to add/remove MCPs. The Settings dialog simply toggles the `disabled` flag and shows summaries.
- Skills are directories under `~/.kiro/skills`. Each folder is a skill and appears in the UI:

## Working With Files

- **Uploads:** The paperclip copies files into the current workspace (with collision-safe renaming).
- **FileBar:** Separates created vs accessed files; clicking opens them inline (text/images/PDF/Excel) or via the OS.
- **Slash commands:** `/context`, `/compact`, `/mcp`, etc., run inside the same CLI process.

---

## Security & Permissions

- Tool calls appear as cards so you can approve/deny sensitive actions.
- Workspaces sandbox Kiro to per-task directories.
- External links open via the OS (`shell.openExternal`), keeping the renderer sandboxed.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for additional considerations (no kernel sandbox, relies on Kiro’s permissions, etc.).

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Kiro CLI missing:** Ensure `kiro-cli` is installed or set `KIRO_CLI_PATH`.
- **MCP server not showing:** Edit `~/.kiro/agents/agent_config.json` and refresh Settings.
- **Slash commands do nothing:** Start a session first; slash commands require an active workspace.
- **Long-running `execute_bash`:** Some commands (e.g., interactive `npx`) block until they finish. Add non-interactive flags or run manually if needed.
