# Kiro Assistant - an infinitely resourceful agent to help as a coworker and as an assistant

Kiro Assistant is a general purpose agent with 500+ capabilities.The idea behind Kiro Assistant is that it will help every member of the society and not just software developers. 
It can work along side you as your coworker and help with your work across your business domains: Sales, Marketing, HR, Legal, FSI, Telco etc. All you have to add it is tools (MCPs) and skills. The system can load skills based on context. It can invoke appropriate tools based on context. That is what makes the system truly general purpose.

Kiro Assistant is our customized build of the open-source Agent Cowork desktop application. We replace Claude Code CLI with our own Kiro-CLI. It also takes advantage of Kiro-CLI features like Custom Agents, SubAgent, MCPs, Skills etc.

We improve the UX and capabilities (**500 plus MCP tools & vast array of skills**) compared to Agent Cowork. It can make audio, professional quality video, presentations, excel models, ppts and many more things. It can help you with emails, social media, cancelling unwanted subscriptions, filing expenses etc.

As mentioned, the original Agent Cowork build on top of Claude Code SDK and launches it with Claude Agents SDK. You can launch Kiro CLI from code and easily get the response back from the SQLite database it maintains and updates in real time.

To summarize:
- 🚀 **Native Electron desktop app** Can help with tasks that you didn't know Kiro could help you with: make Audio, Video, Presentations, help you file expenses, cancel subscriptions and so on.
- 🧠 **Powered entirely by `kiro-cli`** (no Claude CLI required) with Kiro look and feel
- 🧩 **500 MCPs through Composio. Additional MCPs for Excel, Pencil Desktop etc** surfaced inside Settings
- 📂 **Auto-provisioned workspaces** per session under `~/Documents/workspace-kiro-assistant/<task-id>`
- 💾 **SQLite-backed history** so conversations stream in real time and persist across launches

# Kiro Assistant is for everyone in the family

We show that Kiro is not only for software developers, but every member of the society, for every member in your family (accessabilty features coming soon..)

# Kiro Assistant is highly versatile

Kiro Assistant has 500+ tools through Composio (ElevanLab for audio, HeyGen for video, Gmail, X tools etc.). 

It can also use local MCPs for Excel and other development environments like Blender, Pencil Desktop etc. As long as you have an MCP, it will figure out how to use it opportunistically.
We have added **playwright** MCP to allow it ability to handle browsers.
We have added **ZAI MCPs** to give it ability to deal with PDFs, Images etc. when the model being used is not multimodal.

It also has a skill repository, e.g. to make 3D animation with threejs and professional video with Remotion. You can add more skills. Skills are loaded dynamically.
That is how skills work.

Even we don't know what it is fully capable of. Please give it a shot!

## Deceptively simple interface

Task: Make me an audio podcast of 3 minutes on Moltbot controversy. I want to upload it to youtube, so create a display image and combine it with mp3 to give me an MP4.

If a model works in `kiro-cli`, it works in Kiro Assistant. So for example, MiniMax M2 can be selected in Kiro CLI, so it will work with Kiro Assistant.
Kiro Assistant always uses the model stored in `~/Library/Application Support/kiro-assistant/assistant-settings.json` (managed through the Settings → Default Model dropdown). If you haven’t picked one yet, it falls back to `claude-opus-4.5`. Every prompt launches a fresh `kiro-cli` process using whatever model is currently selected, so changing the dropdown takes effect on the very next run. **Current limitation:** because the conversation metadata is cached by `kiro-cli`, mid-task changes are only picked up after starting a *new task* (which creates a new working directory). If you switch models midway through an existing task, that session will continue using the originally selected model until you spin up another task.

Available models today:

- `claude-opus-4.6` – experimental Claude Opus 4.6
- `claude-opus-4.6-1m` – experimental Opus 4.6 with 1M context
- `claude-opus-4.5`
- `claude-sonnet-4.5` (current default)
- `claude-sonnet-4.5-1m`
- `claude-sonnet-4`
- `claude-haiku-4.5`
- `deepseek-3.2`
- `kimi-k2.5`
- `minimax-m2.1`
- `glm-4.7`
- `glm-4.7-flash`
- `qwen3-coder-next`

We highly encourage you to start contributing to the project. Kiro-CLI (which wraps Kiro Agents) is awesome. Let us have fun with it

## Architecture Overview

The architecture is simple. It trusts models to be resourceful and figure out a way. We use powerful models and give them necessary tools. In a way it is inspired
by the "bitter lesson".

![Kiro Assistant Principle](images/KiroCoworkPrinciple.png)

Agent Cowork uses Claude Code CLI which has a SDK called Claude Agents SDK. We can launch Kiro-cli directly from code and receive responses (tool_use requests, responses) through real time SQLite database it maintains.

![Agent Cowork vs Kiro Assistant](images/AgentCoworkvsKiroCoworker.png)

This is a technical diagram of various components involved.

![Kiro Assistant Architecture](images/architecture.png)

This is a view of the SQLite database. Every row represents a session.

![SQLite Polling Flow](images/SQLLite.png)

| Layer | Responsibilities | Key Files |
| ----- | ---------------- | --------- |
| **Electron Main** | Boots the BrowserWindow, exposes IPC APIs (`read-file`, `run-kiro-command`, MCP helpers), spawns `kiro-cli chat`, and copies uploads into per-session workspaces. | `src/electron/main.ts`, `src/electron/libs/runner.ts`, `src/electron/libs/mcp-config.ts`, `src/electron/libs/workspace.ts` |
| **React Renderer** | Zustand store + UI components (sessions, prompt bar, MCP settings, file sidebar, file upload). | `src/ui/*` |
| **Kiro CLI runtime** | Talks to models on Amazon Bedrock securely using your Kiro Subscription, executes tools, runs MCP servers, and writes conversation history to its SQLite store. | `/Applications/Kiro CLI.app` or `kiro-cli` on PATH |
| **Persistence** | Assistant metadata/history via `sessions.db`; conversation bodies live in Kiro’s own `~/Library/Application Support/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3`. | `src/electron/libs/session-store.ts` |

More details (mermaid diagrams, SQLite polling strategy, security notes) live in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`docs/INTEGRATION.md`](docs/INTEGRATION.md).

## Installing & Running

### Prerequisites

1. **Kiro CLI** installed and authenticated.
2. **Bun (preferred) or Node.js 18+** for building.
3. **macOS 13+** (the current build targets macOS; Windows/Linux scripts are stubbed but untested).

> Each new session auto-creates a workspace under `~/Documents/workspace-kiro-assistant/<task-id>`. Use the Upload button to place files into that sandbox; the UI no longer asks you to pick folders manually.

### Steps

```bash
# Clone from AWS GitLab
git clone https://gitlab.aws.dev/wwps-asean-sa-genai/Kiro-Cowork.git
cd Kiro-Cowork

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Development mode (Vite + Electron with hot reload)
bun run dev

# Production build (macOS arm64)
bun run dist:mac
```

The macOS bundle is emitted to `dist/mac-arm64/Kiro Assistant.app`. Copy it into `/Applications` (back up any previous version first).

> We spawn `kiro-cli chat --no-interactive --trust-all-tools --wrap never --model <selected-model> --agent kiro-assistant`. Pick the model from Settings → Default Model (or let it use the built-in default).

## Custom Agent Configuration & MCPs

Kiro Assistant instantiates a custom agent named `kiro-assistant`. Its configuration lives in `~/.kiro/agents/agent_config.json`:
You may use these configurations as they are, just remember to place your keys for Composio (that provides search over 500 MCP tools) and ZAI MCP in respective
Replace_with_your_key field.

```json

  "model": "claude-opus-4.5"
}
```

- During the first launch of the packaged DMG, Kiro Assistant automatically copies a **credential-free** template to `~/.kiro/agents/agent_config.json` so you start with the same MCP/server definitions shown above. You still need to fill in your own API keys for services like Composio or ZAI by editing that file later.
- If you don't want the installer to touch an existing config (e.g., on a dev machine where you copy the app straight into `/Applications`), run `launchctl setenv KIRO_SKIP_AGENT_TEMPLATE 1` before opening the app (clear it with `launchctl unsetenv KIRO_SKIP_AGENT_TEMPLATE`). Only configure the file manually if the automatic setup doesn't occur.
- Edit this file to add/remove MCPs. The Settings dialog simply toggles the `disabled` flag and shows summaries.
- Skills are directories under `~/.kiro/skills`. Each folder is a skill and appears in the UI.
- Adding skills is easy. You can add them by copying folders to the above mentioned path, or you can add them using npx command and selecting Kiro option. They will show up in Settings dialogue.
  
**npx skills add remotion-dev/skills`**

## Working With Files

- **Uploads:** The paperclip copies files into the current workspace (with collision-safe renaming).
- **FileBar:** Separates created vs accessed files; clicking opens them inline (text/images/PDF/Excel) or via the OS.
---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Kiro CLI missing:** Ensure `kiro-cli` is installed or set `KIRO_CLI_PATH`.
- **MCP server not showing:** Edit `~/.kiro/agents/agent_config.json` and refresh Settings.
- **Long-running `execute_bash`:** Some commands (e.g., interactive `npx`) block until they finish. You can ask Kiro Assistant to run them without user input.
- **`better-sqlite3` ABI mismatch:** If you see `...better_sqlite3.node was compiled against NODE_MODULE_VERSION 137... requires NODE_MODULE_VERSION 140`, run `npx electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3` to rebuild the native module against the Electron ABI you have installed.

## Sample Applications

1. Audio creation
2. Video creation
3. Excel modelling
4. Helping cancel unwanted subscriptions
5. Social media management
6. Daily tasks (emails, scheduling)

### Product Video Creation Example (click on the image)

It has many skills for PPTs, Excel, Videos etc. Here is a simple promotional video it made using Remotion-Best-Practices skill.

    <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/s46r3NS1V38/0.jpg" alt="Kiro announcement" width="100%">
  </a>


### Converting articles to audio and video podcasts, great for making training videos (click on the image)
You can give it article that you don't have time to read. It can convert them to audio podcasts.

You can even ask it do research for you and make the output into podcasts so you can listen while doing mundane activities.
For example, here it is making a podcast for me on Moltbot controversy. It 1/ did the research, 2/ wrote a script, 3/ produced audio using ElevanLabs (MP3), 
4/ produced a poster, 5/ stitched together the poster and MP3 to produce MP4 using FFMPEG. 

Just listen and remember this is all being orchestrated autonomously by Kiro-CLI. I did not have to do anything.

  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSRqhYI8oeo">
    <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/NSRqhYI8oeo/0.jpg" alt="Video podcast creation" width="100%">
  </a>


If you want to record a training video, you can give it text and it will make a perfectly edited video for you. It will figure out services to use and deliver the final outcome.
You may need to give feedback sometimes (off-coures).

### Excel Modelling Example

Antrhopic announced Claude for Excel. We tried capability of Kiro Assistant to do research and build excel models, it exceeded our expectations.
Below are screenshot of the excel model it built to show impact of AI bool on MAG7 stocks and Saas stocks.

It got this data from reputable sources.

![Excel Modelling Step 1](images/excel1.png)

It didn't just build great tables, it also built great meaningful visualizations.

## Comments on security

It runs on local machine, and accesses files from working directories. It access models on Bedrock through Kiro-CLI. It is no different from using Kiro-CLI. It calls external APIs with users’ own account (OAuth). These are the services that users already trust. There is a proper login flow that helps user log in into services like ElevanLabs, HeyGen, Gmail etc.
Local MCPs like excel, playwright don’t need credentials. We also use ZAI MCPs for dealing with PDFs, Images etc. It gets automatically used if the model being used is not multimodal. User can remove any of the MCPs they don’t prefer.

Typical advisory applicable for any GenAI service applies to this one.

**Remember this is not a production ready project for your sensitive data!**

**Remember this is not a reference architecture, but a prototype.**

If a model works in `kiro-cli`, it works in Kiro Assistant. So for example, MiniMax M2 can be selected in Kiro CLI, so it will work with Kiro Assistant.
