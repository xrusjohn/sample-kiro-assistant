# Kiro Cowork 

kiro Cowork is a general purpose agent with capabilities similar to that of Manus AI and Anthropic Cowork.

Kiro Cowork is our customized build of the open-source Agent Cowork desktop application. We replace Claude Code CLI with our own Kiro-CLI. 
It also takes advantage of Kiro-CLI features like SubAgent, MCPs, Skills etc.

We improve the UX and capabilities (500 plus MCP tools & vast array of skills). It can make audio, professional quality video, presentations, excel models, ppts
and many more things. It can help you with emails, social media, cancelling unwanted subscriptions, filing expenses etc.

As mentioned, the original Agent Cowork build on top of Claude Code SDK and launches it with Claude Agents SDK. We do not have a Kiro SDK yet.
So we develop a custom interface to the Kiro CLI through SQLLiteDatabase where Kiro-CLI stores convesation information.

To summarize:
- 🚀 **Native Electron desktop app** Can help with tasks that you didn't know Kiro could help you with: make Audio, Video, Presentations, help you file expenses, cancel subscriptions and so on.
- 🧠 **Powered entirely by `kiro-cli`** (no Claude CLI required) with Kiro look and feel
- 🧩 **500 MCPs through Composio. Additional MCPs for Excel, Pencil Desktop etc** surfaced inside Settings
- 📂 **Auto-provisioned workspaces** per session under `~/Documents/workspace-kiro-cowork/<task-id>`
- 💾 **SQLite-backed history** so conversations stream in real time and persist across launches

## Model & Provider Compatibility

If a model works in `kiro-cli`, it works in Kiro Cowork: Claude (Anthropic API or Bedrock), Kimi K2, MiniMax M2, DeepSeek, GLM, etc. Configure providers once inside Kiro CLI and the desktop app automatically uses those settings.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture is simple. It trusts models to be resourceful and figure out a way. We use powerful models and give them necessary tools. In a way it is inspired
by the "bitter lesson".

![Kiro Cowork Principle](images/KiroCoworkPrinciple.png)

Agent Cowork uses Cloud Code CLI which has a nice SDK called Claude Agents SDK. We don't have it with Kiro CLI. But we figured out a way by using SQLLiteDB maintained by Kiro CLI cleverly as shown in the diagram.

This is a technical diagram of various components involved.

This is a view of the SQLLite database. Every row represents a session.

| Layer | Responsibilities | Key Files |
| ----- | ---------------- | --------- |
| **Electron Main** | Boots the BrowserWindow, exposes IPC APIs (`read-file`, `run-kiro-command`, MCP helpers), spawns `kiro-cli chat`, and copies uploads into per-session workspaces. | `src/electron/main.ts`, `src/electron/libs/runner.ts`, `src/electron/libs/mcp-config.ts`, `src/electron/libs/workspace.ts` |
| **React Renderer** | Zustand store + UI components (sessions, prompt bar, MCP settings, file sidebar, file upload, slash commands). | `src/ui/*` |
| **Kiro CLI runtime** | Talks to Anthropic-compatible APIs, executes tools, runs MCP servers, and writes conversation history to its SQLite store. | `/Applications/Kiro CLI.app` or `kiro-cli` on PATH |
| **Claude Agent SDK (helper)** | Only used for `generateSessionTitle()` to keep the automatic title suggestion feature. | `src/electron/libs/util.ts` |
| **Persistence** | Cowork metadata/history via `sessions.db`; conversation bodies live in Kiro’s own `~/Library/Application Support/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3`. | `src/electron/libs/session-store.ts` |

More details (mermaid diagrams, SQLite polling strategy, security notes) live in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`docs/INTEGRATION.md`](docs/INTEGRATION.md).

## Installing & Running

### Prerequisites

1. **Kiro CLI** installed and authenticated for your provider (Anthropic, Bedrock, Kimi, etc.).
2. **Claude CLI (optional)** only if you want the legacy helpers (e.g., `/skills`) inside Settings.
3. **Bun (preferred) or Node.js 18+** for building.
4. **macOS 13+** (the current build targets macOS; Windows/Linux scripts are stubbed but untested).

> Each new session auto-creates a workspace under `~/Documents/workspace-kiro-cowork/<task-id>`. Use the Upload button to place files into that sandbox; the UI no longer asks you to pick folders manually.

### Steps

```bash
# Clone from AWS GitLab
git clone https://gitlab.aws.dev/wwps-asean-sa-genai/Kiro-Cowork.git
cd Kiro-Cowork

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Development mode (Vite + Electron with hot reload)
bun run dev

# Production build (macOS arm64)
bun run dist:mac
```

The macOS bundle is emitted to `dist/mac-arm64/Kiro Coworker.app`. Copy it into `/Applications` (back up any previous version first).

> We spawn `kiro-cli chat --no-interactive --trust-all-tools --wrap never --model claude-opus-4.5 --agent kiro-coworker`. Override defaults with `KIRO_DEFAULT_MODEL` / `KIRO_AGENT` before launching the app.

## Custom Agent Configuration & MCPs

Kiro Cowork instantiates a custom agent named `kiro-coworker`. Its configuration lives in `~/.kiro/agents/agent_config.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "kiro-coworker",
  "description": "A custom agent for my workflow",
  "mcpServers": {
    "pencil": {
      "command": "/Applications/Pencil.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/out/mcp-server-darwin-arm64",

    },

        "Z_AI_MODE": "ZAI"
      },
      "disabled": false
    },
    "excel": {

      "args": ["--yes", "@negokaz/excel-mcp-server"],
      "env": {

      },
      "disabled": false
    }
  },
  "tools": [
    "@pencil","@composio","@playwright","@zai-mcp-server","@excel",
    "read","glob","grep","write","shell","aws","web_search","web_fetch",
    "introspect","report","knowledge","thinking","todo","use_subagent"
  ],
  "allowedTools": [
    "@pencil","@composio","@playwright","@zai-mcp-server","@excel",
    "read","glob","grep","write","shell","aws","web_search","web_fetch",
    "introspect","report","knowledge","thinking","todo","use_subagent"
  ],
  "resources": ["skill:///Users/you/.kiro/skills/**/SKILL.md"],
  "prompt": "You are a general purpose agent...",
  "model": "claude-opus-4.5"
}
```

- Edit this file to add/remove MCPs. The Settings dialog simply toggles the `disabled` flag and shows summaries.
- Skills are directories under `~/.kiro/skills`. Each folder is a skill and appears in the UI:

## Working With Files

- **Uploads:** The paperclip copies files into the current workspace (with collision-safe renaming).
- **FileBar:** Separates created vs accessed files; clicking opens them inline (text/images/PDF/Excel) or via the OS.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Kiro CLI missing:** Ensure `kiro-cli` is installed or set `KIRO_CLI_PATH`.
- **MCP server not showing:** Edit `~/.kiro/agents/agent_config.json` and refresh Settings.
- **Slash commands do nothing:** Start a session first; slash commands require an active workspace.
- **Long-running `execute_bash`:** Some commands (e.g., interactive `npx`) block until they finish. Add non-interactive flags or run manually if needed.

## Sample Applications

1. Audio creation
2. Video creation
3. Excel modelling
4. Helping cancel unwanted subscriptions
5. Social media management
6. Daily tasks (emails, scheduling)

### Video Creation Example

It has many skills for PPTs, Excel, Videos etc. Here is a simple promotional video it made using Remotion-Best-Practices skill.

### Excel Modelling Example

Antrhopic announced Claude for Excel. We tried capability of Kiro Cowork to do research and build excel models, it exceeded our expectations.
Below are screenshot of the excel model it built to show impact of AI bool on MAG7 stocks and Saas stocks.

It got this data from reputable sources.

It didn't just build great tables, it also built great meaningful visualizations.
